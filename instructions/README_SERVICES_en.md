Expandable list of services is to be found [here](https://github.com/AdamGiergun/IfR-data/blob/main/data/services.json) 
```
    {
      "id": "reception",
```
 - id for service, propose english name for it
```
      "dbType": "new",
```
 - as in other cases, "new" is for a new record, "update" for updated   
```
      "name": {
        "en": "Reception",
        "pl": "Punkt recepcyjny",
        "ru": "Стойка регистрации",
        "uk": "Прийом"
      }
    }
```
   - I hope it's quite self-explanatory. It is possible to use any official language acronym from [List of IANA language subtags](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry).
     (use "Subtag:" of "Type: language")
